# Assignment 2 R Code

# Prepared by Michael Pallante

# The objective is to develop plus-minus measures 
# that may be used to predict the results of one of the
# playoff match-ups. So let's focus on a subset of the 
# play-by-play data for the season, using data for just two teams
# that made the 2017-18 NBA playoffs.
